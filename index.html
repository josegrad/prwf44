<p>A holiday house can look in many ways, depending on the owner’s needs and wishes. Today’s fantastic residential structure was designed by McBride Charles Ryan and bears the name Klein Bottle House. With a built surface of 258 square meters, the vacation house is located in the Mornington Peninsula, Australia. Named after what is known in mathematics as a non-orientable surface, the asymmetric structure displays a fascinating play of lines and volumes. Using CAD technology, the architects were able to create a complex architectural masterpiece.</p>

<p>Located between tee-trees on the sand dunes not far away from Melbourne, the Klein Bottle House captures the best of modern technology and wild nature. The inhabitants will have an extraordinary time here , both inside and outside. “What began as a spiral or shell like building developed into a more complex spiral, the Klein bottle”, say architects of McBride Charles Ryan and we can see how their hard work influences the owner’s well-being and pride. Wouldn’t you be proud owning a vacation house like this one? (<em>Found on</em> <em>WorldArchitectureNews</em>)</p>

      	<div class="reading">
<p>If you are a professional weaver like the owner of this amazing workplace, you should invest in your  surrounding space and allow it to tell the story of your passion. What you are looking at is a modern Weaving Studio designed by Prentiss Architects and located on the San Juan Island, Washington.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27610" title="Weaving-Studio-by-Prentiss-Architects" src="Weaving-Studio-by-Prentiss-Architects.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="406"></p>
<p>Prepared for the time the weaver’s husband will retire and they can move to the island, the fascinating studio space will encourage and challenge the owner to create and enjoy her work. The large studio area shelters items like looms and dying facilities and has two areas – one is the sewing and assembly zone, and the other one is the office. A wet room that can be easily opened to dissipate dying fumes and speed up drying works is used to its full potential.</p>
<p>Besides using the space as a work place, the owner would also utilize it for holding weaving guild meetings and displaying her work, so it had to be welcoming and flooded with natural light. An additional bedroom and bath for guests ensure an added inviting feeling, while sliding panels have two purposes – acts as display for weaving projects and also hide the back rooms and storage space. After looking at the photos, you will understand why this work space was created with a purpose which it admirably met. (<em>Found on Homedit</em>)</p>

<p>Gig Harbor, located in the city of Washington, gives Scott Allen Architecture another reason to be proud of. This time, it is the <strong>Cliff House</strong>  that takes the Harbor into the heart of millions abroad.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27784" title="Cliff House - Decoist 1" src="Cliff-House-Decoist-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
<p>An exuberant construction which bagged the Northwest Design Awards in 2006, the house is located in a water-bound terrain, and offers a cool stay round up the year. Glass elevator and roof-top lawn are the most distinctive features. From the sod roof, you get a beautiful view at the spectacular landscape in which the house is situated. There is a bridge originating from the outdoor living area in the ground floor to connect both levels.</p>
<p>This marvelously furnished house receives you directly to the living area, decorated with gorgeous cushion set and magnificent show case. Dining room and outdoor space appears to be an extension to living area. Kitchen is moderately furnished with advanced kinds of appliances, and bedrooms are all bath attached, and decorated with expensive bedding.</p>
<p>The house was erected in a place where an old guest house and boathouse was situated previously. Since it is so close to environmentally fragile landscape, regulatory agencies constantly interfered citing ecological constraints. Amid such hostile atmosphere, the designers were successful in erecting a structure without breaching environmental restrictions.</p>

<p>There’s nothing like spending time in a beautiful garden! A blooming space celebrates nature, soothes the soul and inspires creativity. Public gardens are filled with interesting design choices, but when it comes to planning a garden at home, the possibilities can seem overwhelming. Today we’ve got some answers! From amazing landscaping ideas to unique garden features, we’ve collected the best options for a nature-filled space that makes an impression.</p>
<p><img src="gardening-ideas.jpg" alt="" title="gardening ideas" width="600" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27694"></p>
<h2>Flower Gardens</h2>
<h3>Terraced Flowerbeds</h3>
<p>Colorful blossoms are a representation of new life. While planting flowers seems like second nature, why cultivate a space that looks like every other garden? Try terraced flowerbeds, which offer layers of landscaping options. Better yet–mix blooms with interesting greenery for a modern effect, as shown in the image below. <em>[from Greenfingers]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27532" src="Small-Space-Garden-Terrace.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<h3>Log Border Flowerbed</h3>
<p>Stones, concrete and horizontal wooden beams are common flowerbed borders, but what about vertical logs? Sometimes injecting a bit of the unexpected delights the senses. The height of the border and the silver-white hue of the wood are two eye-catching reasons to give this idea a try! <em>[from Cheap Seeds]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27531" src="Log-Lined-Flower-Bed.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<h3>A Rocky Flower Garden</h3>
<p>Speaking of unexpected, the patchy garden below combines low-lying blooms, lush vegetation and substantial rocks to create a feast for the eyes. <em>[from Garden Dream]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27530" src="Rock-Garden.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="410"></p>
<h3>Floral Containers</h3>
<p>Don’t forget the power of an interesting container. The flowers below are an assortment of rich tones, but their careful arrangement is a work of art. Surprise yourself with some intentional planting and watch as your floral sculpture comes to life. <em>[images below from The Art Garden]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27555" src="Floral-Container.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>Don’t forget to add height with tall plants and let some of the greenery spill over the edges. There can be many levels of detail to your arrangement:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27556" src="Flowers-in-a-Container.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="878"></p>
<h2>Garden Greenery</h2>
<h3>Sculpted Shrubs</h3>
<p>Trimmed hedges evoke the magic of an English garden. For a twist on this classic technique, try planting the shrubs inside of the flowerbeds, then tame them into sphere-like forms for a contemporary look that’s full of charm. <em>[from Down to Earth Landscapes]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27547" src="Shrubs.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="322"></p>
<h3>Greenery Meets Color</h3>
<p>Another way to add surprise to a garden is through contrast. Choose red-leafed plants for variety, and surround them with greenery to make their color pop. <em>[image of Chandor Gardens, from The Road Trip Destination Guide]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27572" src="Greenery-Meets-Color.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<h3>Eye-Catching Trellises</h3>
<p>Oh, the beauty of a vine-filled trellis! While covered with flowers for part of the year, this garden focal point is most often pure green in color. Enhance its verdant appearance by strategically planting an assortment of grasses and shrubs in the space around it. The result: a natural paradise filled with various shades of green! <em>[from Natural Home &amp; Garden]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27570" src="Trellis1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></p>
<h3>Cascading Vegetation</h3>
<p>For texture and length, add “Silver Falls” dichondra to your garden. Not only does it serve as a silvery ground cover, it’s simply irresistible hanging from a tall perch. Who says a glittering waterfall has to be liquid? <em>[from Fine Gardening]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27565" src="Silver-Falls-Dichondra.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
<h3>A Garden Green</h3>
<p>While many yards have at least a patch of lawn, few elegantly frame the space in a way that calls attention to the grass itself. In the image below, a low border of bricks and plants elegantly surrounds the lawn, creating a true “green.” A garden sculpture becomes a stately showpiece in this setting. <em>[image of Dumbarton Oaks Garden, from Daily Tea Enjoyment]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27566" src="Garden-Green.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<h2>Garden Pathways</h2>
<h3>Grid Path</h3>
<p>Pathways create movement throughout the garden. Taking the time to make these walkways as beautiful as they are functional enhances an outdoor space. Instead of placing concrete tiles side by side, leave some room in between the stones, as shown below. The result is a grid effect that becomes lush when filled in with grass. <em>[from archinspire]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27533" src="Grid-Pathway.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338"></p>
<h3>Plant and Stone Pathways</h3>
<p>If stepping stones lead garden-goers through dirt rather than grass, try filling the space in between with low-lying plants. Even if they spill over onto the stones, the resulting mounds of vegetation are visually stunning. <em>[from Fun Design Ideas]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27534" src="Garden-Footpath.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="634"></p>
<p>Plants aren’t the only pathway fillers… Add some rocks to the mix! Pebbles can create a modern look, especially when combined with rectangular walkway tiles and sprout-like grasses. <em>[from Living Colour Landscapes]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27535" src="Rocky-Garden-Footpath-.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="369"></p>
<h3>Footpath as Flowerbed</h3>
<p>What if your garden paths were framed as purposefully as the flowerbeds? Creating borders for a walkway makes attractive tiles even more prominent, especially when the stone is dark and surrounded with white pebbles. The best part: You don’t have to mow or fertilize these outdoor pathways! <em>[from MundoHogar.com]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27541" src="Footpath-as-Flowerbed.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<h3>Boxwood Borders</h3>
<p>Another way to outline a garden path involves the use of hedges. Boxwood is a hardy border plant of choice. Instead of creating straight lines with your walkways, cultivate them to open onto wider resting spaces, as shown below. The boxwood can then curve in response, creating geometric interest. <em>[from Living Colour Landscapes]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27536" src="Boxwood-Trim.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="449"></p>
<h2>Garden Seating</h2>
<h3>Simple Seating</h3>
<p>Gardens are quiet places of contemplation, and nothing promotes this thoughtfulness like a welcoming place to sit. Don’t hesitate to keep it simple! A slab of concrete becomes a modern bench in the image below. <em>[from paperblog]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27573" src="Concrete-Slab-Seating.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="398"></p>
<h3>Tree Trunk Seating</h3>
<p>Solid. Natural. Unexpected. There is power in the sturdy statement of a tree trunk, especially when arranged around a wooden table for group seating options. <em>[from Jackson &amp; Fourth Garden Design]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27574" src="Tree-Trunk-Seating.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399"></p>
<h3>Curved Benches</h3>
<p>While a bench made of stacked stone is an ideal resting place, its unique curved shape is what commands attention below. Surrounding spaces can be just as important as seating itself, especially when a geometrically pleasing sanctuary takes center stage.<em> [from Down to Earth Landscapes]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27539" src="Sitting-Area.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="322"></p>
<h3>Outdoor Dining</h3>
<p>Sometimes seating involves eating! Make outdoor dining spaces appealing with clean, flat surfaces like the slatted furnishings below. Add privacy with tall bamboo, and don’t forget the intrigue of sculptural elements! <em>[from DIY Network]</em></p>
<p><em></em><br><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27540" src="Bamboo-Trim.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338"></p>
<h2>Water Features</h2>
<h3>Tropical Pond</h3>
<p>Water features are a calming presence in the garden. Deciding where and how to install them can take much thought and careful planning. Consider the space itself, the type of surrounding vegetation involved, and what is practical for your time and budget. Below,  a rectangular, contemporary pond complements lush tropical plants. <em>[from Gardenhouse]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27542" src="Tropical-Garden.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<h3>Boxed Pond on a Green</h3>
<p>There is indeed something powerfully simple about a boxy pond, especially when surrounded by manicured hedges and a flawless green lawn.<em> [from Down to Earth Landscapes]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27543" src="Boxwood-Green.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="452"></p>
<h3>Square Koi Pond</h3>
<p>Reinforce the shape of your pond by planting a delicate boxwood border around the perimeter. For an extra touch, add a birdbath or other statuesque item in the center of the water feature, as shown in the koi pond image below.  <em>[from Down to Earth Landscapes]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27544" src="Square-Koi-Pond.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="322"></p>
<h3>Birdbaths and Fountains</h3>
<p>Remember that water features don’t have to be fancy to make an impact. Birdbaths and fountains are lovely garden additions, especially when given prominent placement. For example, a layer of polished stones can create an ideal bed for a ground fountain. <em>[from Outdoorlivinguk]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27568" src="Ground-Fountain.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
<h2>Container Gardening</h2>
<h3>Indoor Container Gardening</h3>
<p>If a garden in the yard is not possible, don’t forget about indoor plant options! An assortment of attractive container choices and styles makes indoor gardening a reality. Interesting vegetation, including the silvery Tillandsia “air plant” below, turns potted plants into conversation pieces. <em>[images below from MulchMaid]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27549" src="Air-Plant.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>If the container is the canvas and the plants are the paints, remember to add variety to your composition! Choose vegetation of different colors and heights, and include nonliving elements such as rocks to turn empty pots into interesting plantscapes.</p>

<h3>Modern Meets Traditional Gardening</h3>
<p>Another way to create compelling potted plant arrangements involves mixing the modern with the traditional. For example, fill contemporary concrete planters with feminine flowers, as seen in the container on the left (below). <em>[from Judy Reyes Photos]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27551" src="Concrete-Containers.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>A reverse of the concept is equally striking! Instead of filling modern pots with conventional blooms, fill traditional containers, such as urns, with modern succulents for a surprising contrast. <em>[from Inspire Bohemia]</em></p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27553" src="Succulents-in-an-Urn1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></h3>
<h3>Matching Containers</h3>
<p>The repetition of matching containers can unify a garden of potted selections. Choose similar colors and styles for your plants, or for a more minimalist yet powerful approach, go for multiples of the same pot. <em>[from Land Escapes]</em></p>

<h3>Cinder Block Wall</h3>
<p>The DIY project below is one of the most unique uses of cinder blocks on record! Stacking these everyday items to create a wall of modern planters results in an architectural masterpiece. Filling the holes in the blocks with succulents is the icing on the cake! <em>[from Potted]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27576" src="Cinderblock-Wall1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<h3> Rooftop Gardening</h3>
<p>We end with the wonder of a rooftop garden! The simplest of containers are effective in this space. For an added touch, display pots and watering cans. These practical details are garden-worthy, but they don’t require any weeding or tending! <em>[from NY Terrace]</em></p>

<p>Close to the steep edges of the Churfirsten Mountains on one side and Walensee Lake on the other, the <strong>Wohnhaus Am Walensee residence</strong> has quite a lot to boast about. Nestled in a beautiful landscape and amidst scattered vegetation of Switzerland, the two-storey contemporary building offers a spectacular view of the amazing mountains from the front and back facades.</p>

<p>Completed in a rectangular layout, the house is built principally of wood and concrete. Use of glass brings a classic feeling to this residence. Its design has come from studio K_M Architektur, an Austrian based architectural firm. And, this building was completed in 2007.</p>
<p>The design is very compact, and simplicity is its most distinguished feature. Walensee Lake is perhaps  the largest lake in Switzerland, and it ensures a warm atmosphere inside this house even in times of harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<p>Comfort is guaranteed inside this contemporary structure, even in the absence of any kind of sophisticated devices. So, it appears that the house is an ideal option for those who place comfort above everything else. Glass doors and windows can be counted among attractive features of this Swiss residence. The location offers complete peace of mind and tranquility to residents. Photovoltaic panels are neatly arranged on rooftop to tap solar energy, which saves a major portion of energy expenditure. <em>(found on HomeDSGN)</em></p>

<p>Spring is here, and with the arrival of warmer weather and new blooms comes the desire to refresh the home. Perhaps it’s been awhile since you’ve dusted the tops of tables, or maybe it’s time to pack those winter clothes away. From tidying strategies to organizational hints, we’ve compiled a list of spring cleaning tips to guide you through the process. Here’s to new beginnings!</p>
<h2>Home Organization</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the inside of the home. In fact, let’s open drawers and closet doors and determine what needs to stay, what can go, and how to organize what’s left! Begin the process by assessing your storage needs and taking a trip to a shop that sells bins, drawer dividers and other handy containers. In fact, purchasing a stylish filing or shelving system is a great incentive to do the more tedious work that lies ahead! <em>[image from The Container Store]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27767" src="The-Container-Store.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
<h3>Closet Organization</h3>
<p>Closets are often sites of spring’s trickiest cleaning endeavors. Start by removing items that don’t belong. Perhaps stacks of holiday decorations have migrated to the corner, or maybe there are clothes that you are ready to part with. Remove items for donation and make room for warm-weather clothes. Pack away winter sweaters so spring colors can really shine! <em>[dresses from dELiA*s]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27827" src="Spring-Dresses-from-Delias.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="421"></p>
<p>For pantries and supply closets, consider adding shelving for your storage needs. See-through drawers organize without hiding the contents inside! Below, The Container Store’s Like-it Modular Drawers neatly stow art supplies.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27768" src="Container-Store-Modular-Drawers.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600"></p>
<p>There are times when concealing the contents of a drawer or box is extremely helpful. Keep closets tidy with RiverRidge Storage Bins from Target (shown below). These opaque containers are also perfect for kids’ rooms, and they are attractive enough to display.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27770" src="Target-RiverRidge-Storage-Bins.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
<h3>Pantry Organization</h3>
<p>Take stock of pantry supplies. Toss products that are no longer fresh, then make sure items that were hidden in the back now see the light of day. Is there a new way to organize your pantry goods? For example, group snacks on one shelf, canned goods on another, and baking items in a space of their own. <em>[image from Daily Clutter]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27856" src="An-Organized-Pantry.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="570"></p>
<h3>Drawer Organization</h3>
<p>Even small spaces are in need of attention! Kitchen and bathroom drawers may be areas of clutter. Purchase drawer organizers for products like cooking tools and cosmetics. At the very least, sort items by type and group them together. <em>[image from Kit Cosmetics]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27852" src="Nail-Polish.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="562"></p>
<h3>Office Organization</h3>
<p>When you’re done with the closets and drawers, head to the rooms of your home that are in need of special organizational help. Chances are, you’ll end up in the office! Luckily a range of stylish storage products can give your work space a clean look. Begin by removing or shredding documents you no longer need to keep. Invest in a good filing cabinet, and neatly group papers by purpose. A helpful hint: the more often you need an item, the more accessible it should be. <em>[image from The Container Store]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27771" src="Container-Store-Desk-Organizers.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="348"></p>
<p>Choose standing drawers to conceal stacks of copy paper or small items like paperclips and pens. If possible, unify your containers with a similar color or style in order to create a clutter-free look. For example, The Container Store’s Landscape Paper Drawer nicely coordinates with other translucent organizers:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27769" src="Container-Store-Landscape-Paper-Drawer.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="417"></p>
<h3>Garage Organization</h3>
<p>While finding the motivation to organize the garage may be difficult in the cold of winter, warmer spring temperatures make the task bearable. Once again, take a good look at items you haven’t used in months or years. Is it time to donate them? Next, make sure that much-needed supplies are visible. Invest in wall-hanging organizers for tools and other equipment so they are attractively at-the-ready. <em>[image below from Total Garage Systems]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27838" src="Organizing-the-Garage.png.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Household Cleaning</h2>
<p>There’s no way around it: you’ve got to begin the cleaning tasks at hand! Just because you must scrub doesn’t mean you have to be toxic about it. Choose environmentally-friendly products when possible, or make your own from household items like baking soda and vinegar. When you settle on a cleaning material, don’t be shy–sweep, mop, vacuum and wash. You’ll thank yourself when you see the gleaming home that results! <em>[image from TLC]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27772" src="Cleaning-Products.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="364"></p>
<h3>Dusting Surfaces</h3>
<p>Give your home a thorough dusting, including walls and baseboards. You’ll be amazed by the layer of grime that appears on the cloth but ultimately pleased with the sparkling results! <em>[image from Westchester Woodcrafters]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27850" src="Dust-Free-Surfaces.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="426"></p>
<h3>Cleaning Carpets</h3>
<p>While the cleaning basics of home maintenance may be obvious, don’t forget about often-overlooked details like rugs. Spot-treat stains on carpets after a heavy vacuum. It’s amazing how removing a few blotches can make flooring look brand spanking new! If it’s been awhile since a good scrub, it may be time for a carpet shampoo. <em>[rug from Jonathan Adler]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27773" src="Jonathan-Adler-rug.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="473"></p>
<h3>Cleaning Upholstery</h3>
<p>Couches and chairs can be spot-cleaned as well. To begin, rub upholstery with a dry cleaning sponge to pick up stray particles and grime. Don’t forget to remove spare change and other surprises from under the cushions! For more details, check out both the shortcut and full-length tutorial at Real Simple. <em>[image of Butterfield Sofa from Jonathan Adler]</em></p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27841" src="Jonathan-Adler-Butterfield-Sofa.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></h3>
<h3>Updating Textiles</h3>
<p>Now that the cleaning is done, it’s time for some fun! Refresh your decor by switching out dark or heavy textiles with light, springy alternatives. Switch winter pillows with vibrant selections like West Elm’s Clinton Friedman Palm Pillow Cover (shown below). Speaking of pillows, make sure you start the spring with a clean resting space for your head. Check out Decoist’s pillow cleaning tutorial here.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27825" src="Clinton-Friedman-Palm-Pillow-Cover.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600"></p>
<p>Some folks find spring to be the perfect time for a drape update! Choose colors that mimic newly blooming flowers or the bright blue sky. Z Gallerie’s Mimosa Panels in aquamarine add a crisp touch to a white-walled room:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27826" src="Z-Gallerie-Mimosa-Panels.jpg" alt="" width="707" height="457"></p>
<h3>Rotating Artwork</h3>
<p>Take the opportunity to refresh the walls with bright colors. Dig out those framed posters you didn’t think you had room for, or make a new purchase for the new season! <em>[framed art from Monster Marketplace]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27854" src="Tree-Top-Owls-I-Framed-Art.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600"></p>
<h3>Patio Cleaning</h3>
<p>Don’t forget about the exterior of your home! Sweep the leaves off the patio, wipe down furnishings and get ready for some outdoor lounging and dining. <em>[image of the Mendocino Dining Set from Crate &amp; Barrel]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27824" src="Crate-and-Barrel-Patio-Furniture.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="329"></p>
<h3>Yard Maintenance</h3>
<p>When you’ve stepped off the patio, turn your attention to the lawn. With the sun out from behind winter clouds, the grass is in growing mode. Give it a good spring mow, removing leaves and branches from the yard as well. Don’t forget about those pesky weeds! <em>[image below from Sunset magazine via Stephmodo]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27829" src="Yard-Maintenance.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="872"></p>
<h3>Trim Touch-Up</h3>
<p>Does the trim on your home’s exterior need an update? Peruse paint samples for new ideas, or touch up existing paint on window frames, shutters and doors. <em>[image from Charles &amp; Hudson]</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27833" src="Pantone-Paint-Samples.png1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<h3>Window Washing</h3>
<p>Give your spring cleaning a glossy finish. That’s right–it’s time to wash the windows! While cleaning the glass from the inside of the home adds shine to your interior, wiping down panes from outdoors will make your home the gleaming gem of the neighborhood!</p>

<p>Ever since the hit American television show <em>Mad Men </em>first aired in 2007, it has captured the attention of audiences with its detailed depiction of Mid-Century Modern style. From the fashion to the interiors, the series’ 1960s-inspired design is as sleek as it is glamorous. Set in the world of New York’s Madison Avenue advertising scene, <em>Mad Men</em> captures the essence of an era when clean-lined furnishings were all the rage.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, ’50s and ’60s Modern styles have become mainstream, and many retail chains and upscale shops regularly offer furnishings influenced by Mid-Century design. In conjunction with the much-anticipated premiere of <em>Mad Men’s </em>Season 5, we explore several of the program’s interiors and show you how to get a ’50s/’60s Modern look with decor both vintage and new.</p>
<h2>Mid-Century Modern Office Furniture</h2>
<h3>Don Draper’s Office</h3>
<p>Don Draper (played by Jon Hamm) is a skilled ad agency creative director with a mysterious past. His no-nonsense attitude is mirrored in the decor of his classy, no-frills office, which oozes style with a neutral palette.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27713" src="Mid-Century-Office-Furniture.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337"></p>
<p>Shades of cream and tan may dominate, but pops of color accent the space. A teal glass bowl rests on the wooden coffee table, and at the other end of the room, hot orange chairs brighten meeting times:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27715" src="A-Mid-Century-Office.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27728" src="Don-Drapers-Office1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="334"></p>
<p>To get the ’60s look of Don’s office, start with the Arden Sofa by Jonathan Adler (shown below). Its tapered legs give a nod to Mid-Century style, but new materials make this piece fresh.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27761" src="Jonathan-Adler-Arden-Sofa1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="200"></p>
<p>To bring color into your own space, turn to some vintage glassware of the Murano variety! This beloved line of Italian glass was particularly popular in the ’50s and ’60s, and avid collectors still treasure it today. Note the retro bubble glass on the piece below, which sold at Fine Vintage Design.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27718" src="Blue-Murano-Bowl1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>Finally, add some fire to the mix with executive chairs in tones of red-orange. Design Within Reach features two swiveling selections by noted designer Eero Saarinen. The Saarinen Executive Side Chair with Casters (left) and the Saarinen Executive Armchair with Casters (right) are both shown in crimson.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27734" src="Saarinen-Chairs-from-Design-Within-Reach.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338"></p>
<h3>Roger Sterling’s Office</h3>
<p>Speaking of Saarinen, the office of ad agency partner Roger Sterling (played by John Slattery) is filled with the work of this famous designer. Note the table and stools below. Also of interest is the curved chrome floor lamp, as well as the black and white painting, created for the show in the tradition of works by Op Artist by Bridget Riley.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27719" src="A-60s-Mod-Office.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="336"></p>
<p>To add some gloss to your space, check out the Saarinen Low Oval Coffee Table from Design Within Reach (shown below). Though the piece displays a marble top, it’s available in a variety of colors and materials. In other words, Roger Sterling’s white-top table can be yours!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27736" src="Saarinen-Table.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="336"></p>
<p>Spotlight your Mid-Century finds with a replica of the iconic Arco floor lamp, originally designed by Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni in 1962. This version comes from Iconic Lights.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27742" src="Arco-Floor-Lamp-Replica.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="622"></p>
<h3>Mid-Century Meeting Room</h3>
<p>When it’s time to brainstorm, Sterling Cooper Draper Price employees head to a vibrant room where bright advertising copy is displayed as art, and orange-hued furnishings contrast steel gray walls.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27720" src="Mid-Century-Office-Design.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="336"></p>
<p>A popular Mid-Century color of choice, orange is still alive and well in the design world of today. For a modern take on the sofa above, check out Ted Boerner’s Theatre Sofa in Ultrasuede, available at Design Within Reach. The couch’s chromed steel base gives it a striking similarity to 1960s office furniture.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27738" src="Theatre-Sofa-in-Ultrasuede.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="357">To incorporate a shiny coffee table, check out IKEA‘s KLUBBO Coffee Table in white (shown below). The metal legs make it timeless, but if paired with the right sofa, this piece screams Mid-Century.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27730" src="IKEA-KLUBBO-Coffee-Table.png.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="303"></p>
<h2>Mid-Century Modern Home Furnishings</h2>
<h3>Don and Betty Draper’s Living Room</h3>
<p>When work is done, it’s time to relax at home. Where does Don Draper live? In upstate New York, of course. In Season 3 of <em>Mad Men, </em>Don’s wife Betty (played by January Jones) hires an interior designer to update the family’s living room. The result includes “a Dunbar Japanese-influenced sofa,” “silk dupioni drapes,” and a “classic Drexel end table.” We’re drawn to the upholstered chairs in a lattice print (shown below)!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27749" src="60s-Living-Room3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337"></p>
<p>To celebrate the power of geometric patterning, pick up a pair of Morrow Slipper Chairs by Jonathan Adler. The Ibiza Mocha pattern blends earthy tones with modern flair:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27741" src="Morrow-Slipper-Chairs-by-Jonathan-Adler.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="388"></p>
<h3>Pete and Trudy Campbell’s Dining Room</h3>
<p>The New York City apartment of Pete and Trudy Campbell (played by Vincent Kartheiser and Alison Brie) has a youthful vibe, and modern artwork and collectibles enhance the space. Equally eye-catching are the pointy edges of the couple’s dining room chairs and the built-in room divider/screen that separates the living and dining areas.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27725" src="Mid-Century-Dining-Room.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="336"></p>
<p>For a contemporary take on room dividing, check out the Desmond Wooden Screen from Jonathan Adler. These hinged treasures are available in both white lacquer and walnut.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27731" src="Jonathan-Adler-Desmond-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="549"></p>
<p>The unique shape of Pete and Trudy’s dining room chairs is echoed in recent designs from Dwell Studio. The angles and curvature of the Selma Arm Chair and Selma Side Chair can’t help but conjure Mid-Century form.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27744" src="Selma-Chairs-from-Dwell-Studio.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="385"></p>
<h3>Joan and Greg Harris’ Color Scheme</h3>
<p>Joan Harris (played by Christina Hendricks) is one of <em>Mad Men’s </em>more colorful characters, and the apartment she shares with her husband Greg (Samuel Page) is equally vibrant. We end by exploring the dwelling’s palette of coral-toned orange and minty slate blue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27724" src="Orange-and-Blue-Color-Palette.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27751" src="Mid-Century-Color-Palette.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337"></p>
<p>To fully enjoy the possibilities of this color combination, we’ve handpicked a few ’50s/’60s Modern-style finds from today’s retailers and designers. Below, the Brighton Sofa from Z Gallerie is soothing in aquamarine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27753" src="Z-Gallerie-Brighton-Sofa-in-Aquamarine.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="306"></p>
<p>To add a touch of orange, incorporate pillows in shades of coral rose from West Elm:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27754" src="West-Elm-Washed-Linen-Pillow-Cover.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600">Last but not least, Jonathan Adler‘s Large Jade Bird Bowl is pottery at its finest, while the Lava Bud Vase Set introduces stylish elements of texture and form:</p>

<p>Cleaning pillow covers is more or less like cleaning your dress, yet cleaning your actual pillows might be tiresome. But it’s very important from a hygienic point of view, so we have some tips that will help you out — you can either go for a machine wash or a hand wash.</p>
<p><img src="washing-actual-pillows.jpg" alt="" title="washing actual pillows" width="600" height="453" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27680"></p>
<h3>Pillows machine washing</h3>
<p>For machine wash, use a moderately hard liquid detergent and a few drops of bleach. Also use a good fabric conditioner for better cleaning, and color-fast bleach if your pillow is colored. Set the machine in gentle mode, and rinse it for 2 or 3 cycles. Turn the pillows several times in the midst of rinsing. Drain as much of water as possible before drying, and punch it towards the end to fluff up.</p>
<h3>Pillows hand washing</h3>
<p>For hand washing too, principles remain almost same except the intervention of machine. Fill the beaker with warm water, and add some detergent and a pinch of bleach. Sink the pillow in this mixture, and let it stand for about half an hour or so. Squeeze and rinse it several times to get rid of extra soap. Place it on a horizontal platform for a while to drain off excess moisture, before putting it in dryer. Punch it to fluff.</p>
<h3>Drying the pillows</h3>
<p>Cleaning is done, and now it’s time for drying. Put it in the dryer for some time, take them out and hang in moisture free area. Drying would take some days, and you can dry it under sun to speed up the process.</p>
