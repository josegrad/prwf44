<p>Rene Haas is one of the most renowned South African furniture designers. Born in Switzerland, Rene has made it her mission to excel in delivering first class interiors — for that she established her company, Muralto, in 1968, which delivers cutting edge furniture to even the pickiest of clients.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25458" title="Muralto UK" src="Muralto-UK.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="211"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25457" title="Muralto UK, Central London" src="Muralto-UK-Central-London.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>Last year, Muralto decided to launch in the UK market and they made quite a debut with their showroom in Central London. A great example of contemporary furnishings, the new showroom promises to deliver a fully bespoke design service along with a huge selection of high quality accessories including art, lighting, mirrors and rugs.</p>
<p>The interior is highly appealing and nothing short of bold. It features Muralto’s cutting edge furniture and accessories together with the latest home entertainment systems from RS AV Solutions  — who by the way, provided the stunning audio video installation. On the walls we could spot canvases by British Pop Artist Gordon House or South African Pop Artist, Russell Travers, both having great motifs adding to the elegant feel.</p>
<p>Muralto seems to know a few things about functional furniture for dining, living and bedrooms. Definitely a place I’d visit if I were to be in London. You?</p>

<p>Elasticity, clean, modern lines and a vivid presentation – these words can all be used to describe Fenny Ganatra’s latest project – the Bounce Chair. The Indian designer exhibited the Bounce chair at the 2012 Maison&amp; Object in Paris and many people got to experience it’s “bounciness” and vividly colored parts. Its contemporary design is based on ergonomics studies and countless cycles of testing, so that the final product can offer the best features possible.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25418" title="Bounce-by-Fenny-Ganatra" src="Bounce-by-Fenny-Ganatra.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="502"></p>
<p>You can easily stack a few of the Bounce chairs on top of each other and even use them outside, because their weatherproof feature protects them. Three sets of rubbery bands made out of re-engineered silicone support the body’s weight and offer an interesting, but comfortable seating experience. Care to comment on its shape or want to share your experience with this chair? (<em>Found on Contemporist</em>)</p>

<p>Last week I was writing about this amazing apartment in Moscow with a striking interior that features a modern fireplace. I was amazed. Today, I’m at it again, drooling over the pictures of another flat in the Russian capital city. Located in the famous Triumph Palace building, the lavish interior is the work of designers Alexei Nikolashina, Alexandra Fedorova and Irina Shumaeva.</p>

<p>The apartment is quite airy, or at least that’s how things feel in the living room. There are white walls and floors everywhere, contrasting with darker wooden accents and the yellow bookcase and the wall unit that stylishly houses the TV. Speaking of the living room, it has a minimalist feel enhanced by the open kitchen (separated only by an eye catching ‘suspended’ wooden bar), the unique glass table and the state of the art appliances that will force you to cook from time to time, no matter how good (or not) you are with your herbs.</p>
<p>Who would’ve thought that Moscow hides such gems? Have you seen the bathroom? Or the serene home office? I guess it’s becoming a habit here on Decoist to cover such fine works of art. We’ll let you discover the rest of the apartment …</p>

<p>Treating your window curtains and draperies needs a careful process. As window curtains serve towards protection of your home furnishings, privacy and comfort, it needs very ideal care.</p>
<p>In case of cleaning and treating your curtains, you must be well-informed about the material and construction of clothing before the cleaning process. Beware of sunlight effecting the color patterns and strength of material.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25345" title="elegant contemporary curtains" src="elegant-contemporary-curtains.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="458"></p>
<p>Light colors are more immune to sunlight than the darker ones. Acrylic and polyester stand up to sunlight better than other textile fibers and will maintain color over time. Drapes are more complex structures, made of heavy fabrics, usually extended to the floor, lined, and pleated. Meanwhile, curtains are commonly made up of light weight fabric, are simple structured and easily operable.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-25346" title="elegant Draperies" src="elegant-Draperies.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="344">Draperies can be cared for daily by giving a gentle shaking, preventing dust and dirt from accumulating in the fibers.</p>
<p>Monthly vacuuming is advisable, preferably with a handheld vacuum set in low mode and soft brush attachment. Trims, buttons and embellishments should be checked before vacuuming.</p>
<p>Washing is another area where you have to be extra careful with draperies. Check whether they are labeled washable, the drapery and lining are made of different fibers (one of them may shrink incongruously), sunlight weakened fabric, fabrics constructed with pleats (which may lose its form on washing), or containing trims and embellishments that are not washable or colorfast. Be sure that you are using cold water and mild detergent for soft washing your draperies. Use tumble drying or line drying as appropriate.</p>
<p>Don’t machine wash or dry clean fiber glass draperies. Hand wash them with care using a rubber glove, in a laundry tub with out any cringing, and dry it without any line-dry folding over the clothesline.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-25348" title="sheers" src="sheers.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="480"></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-25347" title="lace curtains" src="lace-curtains.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="636"></p>
<p>Curtains can also be washed with almost the same caution as draperies, but they tend to be more flexible. If your curtains are marked washable, remove hooks, rings, and hardware. Ensure trims are tightly attached and wash per the instructions. Normally curtains can be machine washed on a gentle cycle and tumble dried easily. You can iron the reverse side if necessary and spray lightly with water if seams are puckered.</p>
<p>While lace curtains are easily machine or dry washable with mild cleaning agents, and dip it in starch solution for an extra body look. Also you can re-hang while it is a little damp without starch for a soft-look. But you must temporarily cover the metal hooks with tissue paper for preventing it from rusting with fabric. Sheer fabric curtains can be cleaned in the same way as lace curtains, but be cautious about organdy sheers which should be dry cleaned.</p>

<p>Designed by Wellington-based studio Parsonson Architects, this fantastic vacation residence rising from a densely forested property captures amazing, soothing views. After enjoying the interiors of another residence built by the same architects who worked on this project – the Salamanca House – we invite you to enjoy this contemporary home and see if you can find details that will make you daydream about living here.</p>
<p>Located in Apple Bay, Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand, the  Apple Bay House is accessible by 4 wheel drive vehicle and boat from the nearest township Picton.</p>

Interiors are arranged in such a way that each space gets sunlight and views – the downstairs private spaces benefit from fresh filtered air and treetop views, while the upstairs living spaces end in decks on both side.

<p>It is easy to spot luxury bedding when comparing sheets, pillowcases, and duvets. The difference between luxury bedding and price-minded comparables is visible and detectable by touch. Thread count comes first, with luxury bedding possessing a minimum thread count of 200, and often ranging above 1,000. With a high thread count, bedding will be dense of appearance, so that it interrupts the gaze when one attempts to peer through it. With a lesser thread count, a sheet might be nearly transparent.</p>
<p>Material used in composition is also key, with luxury bedding including nearly 100% fine linens such as Egyptian cotton. As for the weave, Percale and Jacquard are the methods most often used in the assembly of luxury bedding.</p>

<p>For those of you looking for curtains and draperies, who have a hard time deciding what header style to go with, check out the ones we have featured here. All these might give you some insight on the panel designs before selecting what should go into your living room or bedroom. From conventional to latest fashionable designs, our collection bellow has it all. Just tell us which ones you like most.</p>
<p><strong>Pinch Pleats</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25355" title="Pinch Pleats drapery" src="Pinch-Pleats-drapery.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>
<p>This traditional design uses the three fold of fabrics stitched together, that eases the pleat to spread out on the top and bottom. This is also adorned by a valance header with tassel fringe sewn-in to the fold ending.</p>
<p><strong>Goblet Pleats</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25356" title="Goblet pleat with buttons" src="Goblet-pleat-with-buttons.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>This one has tiny pleats that are made with a drape top stitched about four inches down. The stitching lets a cup-shaped fabric poof. This space can be left empty or filled with batting or tissues as you may wish.</p>
<p><strong>Pencil Pleats</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25357" title="Pencil Pleats heading curtains" src="Pencil-Pleats-heading-curtains.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="574"></p>
<p>This is a very feminine design that makes it extra beautiful and sophisticated. The tailored pencil-pleating tapes attached together back to back with strings that cinch up the fabric into a stretched out pleat. This treatment is ideal for stationary panels.</p>
<p><strong>Box Pleated</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25358" title="polyester box pleat curtain" src="polyester-box-pleat-curtain.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="479"></p>
<p>It is one of the wonderful treatment ideal for stationary panels in your bedroom. It needs skillful tailoring and can be creatively detailed with fabric-covered button.</p>
<p><strong>Swagged</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25359" title="swagged drapery" src="swagged-drapery.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>This reminds us of the classic vintage style window treatments. It is two-layered – first layer of pencil-pleated panel can be covered with a plundering fabric edged with silky tassels. Mix and match colors will look good on this styling.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-25360" title="Flat Panels on Pegs" src="Flat-Panels-on-Peg.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250"><strong>Flat Panels on Pegs</strong></p>
<p>Simple but elegant, this panel is very flexible. Flat Panels on Pegs design for any width of fabric can be stitched together and hung by any stylish type of hook or peg.</p>
<p>Though this design sans complicated pleating, it gives a subtle statement.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-25365" title="Flat Panel with Pleated Top" src="Flat-Panel-with-Pleated-Top.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240"><strong>Flat Panel with Folded Cuff</strong></p>
<p>This is another simple but interesting design that can be lined with a matching fabric in the back, which will be displayed at the top edges while folded over between drapery rings.</p>
<p><strong>Flat Panel with Pleated Top</strong></p>
<p>This is an interesting and beautiful design that is made by adding to flat-panel drapes a contrasting fabric folded into three tailored pleats. You can update your traditional pinch-pleat draperies with this queer detail for a change.</p>
<p><strong>Tab Top</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25362" title="elegant contemporary tab top drapery" src="elegant-contemporary-tab-top-drapery.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="530"></p>
<p>One of the most conventional styles that keep reappearing in contemporary avatars! You can usually find this tab-top drapery panels at the country interiors.</p>
<p>Go for the pure white drapes that can be adorned with colored buttons and ribbons to hold the tabs in place and look chic altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Cuffed</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25368" title="Cuffed drapery design ideas" src="Cuffed-drapery-design-ideas.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>Checked fabrics sewn to the top edges of the drapes can form a cuff over the pleats. Sewn-in valance look can provide a unique appearance that forms a cuff over the pleats.</p>
<p><strong>Rod Pocket Ruffles</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25369" title="Rod Pocket Ruffles drapes" src="Rod-Pocket-Ruffles-drapes.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600"></p>
<p>You can make these rod-pocket panels at home that can cover any girth size of poles. This pole can be featured with ribbon or fabric borders, tassels, or tiebacks. Floral and striped fabric on illustrious colors can be very attractive.</p>

<p>Barcelona-based architecture studio Ferrolan LAB designed a small, narrow and long residential structure used by a family as their permanent residence. Measuring 12 feet by 82 feet, the contemporary home located in Barcelona, Spain challenged the architects to construct a comfortable vertically designed collection of spaces.</p>
<p>The ground floor is occupied by the garage and home cinema, while the rest of the spaces are split between private and social rooms. Here, a mezzanine level features two rooms connected by a living-study opening towards a patio garden. Upstairs, occupying the first floor, lie the kitchen and dining room, while the second floor shelters the bedrooms. Topped off with a pool terrace on the roof, the narrow home is surely a successful residential project.</p>

<p>Chances are that you wouldn’t believe this  functional and chic little home was once a garage. Owned by Darren Issac and located in Camden, UK, the bright and beautiful house was designed by Knott Architects to perfectly use every inch of space so that it looks much larger than it actually is.</p>
<p>Downstairs there’s a bedroom and a wetroom nicely separated by glass screens and a large wardrobe that also acts as a divider. A small office room adds to the charm, and not only overlooks the street but proves just as useful as it doubles up as a guest bedroom whenever needed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25263" title="Old Garage Makeover 1" src="Old-Garage-Makeover-1.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="480"></p>
<p>A staircase leads to the upper floor and is made of rolled steel with a patina of rust. Fireplace logs are stored underneath the staircase. The calf skin LCW chair and the typographical tramlines poster form excellent additions that bring in an element of vintage outlook to this house. The upper floor features a living room, a dining room and a kitchen area. It has floors with engineered oak boards and in order to save wall space there’s an underfloor heating system and a sunken trench heating system in front of the windows. Speaking of maximizing space, it’s a great idea how the bookshelves and the kitchen cupboards are built into the pitched roof.</p>
<p>All these sound like a great effort, but the result is stunning. Another garage makeover gone right. We’re completely in love with this charmer.</p>
