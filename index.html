<p>We seem to have a passion for Swedish apartments and houses as we wrote about plenty of them on Decoist. Today, we’re at it again with a new, rather small, contemporary loft in Post Hall, in central Stockholm. As usual, we’re looking at a black and white interior that makes the 68 sqm area look much larger than it is. And it’s more special, if we may add, thanks to the big windows that allow plenty of natural lighting inside and the dark-stained oak parquet floors for contrast.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26001" title="Black &amp; White Contemporary Loft, living area" src="Black-White-Contemporary-Loft-living-area.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="437"></p>

<p>What you see below is a two room apartment with one bedroom. It’s partially illuminated with spotlights in the ceiling, has an open-space living room and a kitchen with an island and with stylish benches in white coriander, a shower room with a washer and dryer, as well as two contrasting glass panels, and what looks like a very comfortable bedroom accessible directly from the living room. There also seems to be a “hidden” place to house your guests whenever needed — it’s accessible via a ladder, has some functional furniture and a bed, nothing more; just make sure your guests don’t drink too much!</p>
<p>Quite stylish, don’t you think? Costs 4.5M Swedish Crowns, or around $665,000 at today’s rate. <em>(more info here)</em></p>

<p>We’re just a few months away from summer and I’m pretty sure some of you are seeking places to spend your short vacation this year — in style and pampered in luxury, maybe? If so, the exquisite Santorini Island in Greece, could be the perfect spot. And if you decide to go for this, you may also want to consider the <strong>Astarte Suites Hotel</strong>. We just got an email from their general manager with a bunch of pictures and a bit more details, and must say we’re stunned with what Astarte has on offer. Mainly because there are just nine suites, all sitting on the brink of a cliff-edge (yeah, literally) in Akrotiri’s Caldera, boasting spectacular panoramic views across of Aegean Sea.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25964" title="Astarte Suites Santorini exterior pool" src="Astarte-Suites-Santorini-exterior-pool.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="394"></p>

<p>George Moschotis, general manager for Astarte Suites, said — “<em>Cycladic architecture and a style that is sympathetic to the natural surrounds of volcanic lava reliefs lends a sophisticated edge to this boutique hotel. The interior is inspired by ancient Mediterranean cultures, and no two suites are the same. All have jacuzzi tubs, king-size beds and flatscreen televisions. Breakfast is served in the privacy of individual verandas or terraces. With champagne and fresh friut on arrival, complimentary transfers and impeccable staff, this is a glamorous bolthole on one of the most glamorous islands on the planet</em>.”</p>
<p>Folks from Condé Nast Traveller said “<em>This family-run, nine-suites hotel is in the least-developed part of the island. There are panoramas of the caldera, and the village-topped cliffs looking like snow-capped mountains. The best rooms are those with traditional vaulted ceilings. Meals are served on your private terrace.</em>”</p>

<p>Indirect lighting and a light but luxurious atmosphere proved to be the perfect choice for the Sea Shell Residence on Israel’s Mediterranean coast. The interiors of this impressive 7,500 square foot contemporary residence were created by Israel-based studio Lanciano Design. Looking at each of the spaces, a common characteristic of the interiors seems to be the elegant, open spaces filled with ambient lights that create a changing atmosphere.</p>
<p>By choosing a color palette that would compliment the surroundings, the architects dissolved the boundaries between indoors and outdoors and prolonged the dynamic coastline inside. An open floor plan allowed the creation of an L-shaped cooking/living/entertaining zone open to the outside deck and swimming pool. And also check out the Bloom Chair by Kenneth Cobonpuere featured a while back on Decoist – it looks amazing in this house! (<em>Found on Freshome</em>)</p>

<p>Located in a flat landscape near the sea, <strong>Steel Steady House II</strong> in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands, has crept onto the list of most beautiful buildings in that locality. The house has got its design from renowned architects Archipelontwepers. The Steel Steady House II has got wonderful surroundings, with a vast agricultural field on one side and a rich town on the other. There is a silent lake close to the house, for those who love tranquility. Apparently, the house offers a good deal of peacefulness in the midst of urbanity, which appears to be a queer combination.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25851" title="Steel Steady House back entrance" src="Steel-Steady-House-back-entrance-600x399.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399"></p>

<p>As the name indicates, the major material of the Steel Steady House construction is steel. The Steel Steady House II is designed with simple rectangular geometry, with the central space being left open. It’s not just a bunch of separated rooms, but a wonderful architecture, large enough to hold a huge family.</p>
<p>Large glass partition offers unhindered view of the exteriors, whereas the windows opening to the town side get translucent screens that go blind automatically. This ensures maximum privacy for people living inside the house. There is a beautiful pavement from the sidewalk nearby that leads you to the house. The pavement is extremely beautiful, and will entice you to walk over it. Overall, the house is beautiful, tranquil and hygienic, and seems to be brilliant option for people of all ages.</p>

<p>Tired of the supra-modern chandeliers and expensive lamps? Here comes something rusty for you. The lamps designed by Luke Lamp Co would definitely take you back to olden times. These lamps are reminiscent of vintage period or the times when Thomas Alva Edison discovered modern lamps. The very first proof for this is the absence of switches. But, Luke Lamp Co will install one for free, for those who insist.</p>

<p>Again, the appearance of these lamps will definitely bring you back to the good old days. Coir, glass jars, wooden frames and incandescent lamps are the essential components used in its design. One among the Luke’s lamp is “mason jar and rope lamp”, which resembles a tiny Petromax of seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Electric cables are concealed deep inside coir so fears of getting electrocuted are far-off.  As you go through Luke’s collection, you could see a more advanced kind of lamp, the one that’s hung from a wooden piece and fixed with screws. The company has a wide range of table lamps in various grades and forms.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25804" title="diy Luke Lamps" src="diy-Luke-Lamps.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="410"></p>
<p>Some of them look more industrial while others maintain classical nature. You can see caged lamps, lamps held upon wooden stacks, and a heavy duty work-light resembling modern flood lights.  Now, who among you want these lamps? (found on hdf)</p>

<p>Designers <em>Pawel Sokol</em> and<em> Hanka Bajer</em> from Exit Interior Design Studio are the ones guilty for the contemporary feel and the stunning simplicity of this gorgeous apartment in central Warsaw, Poland. Located on the first floor, the bright Eko Park 3 apartment seems small at a first glance, but on a closer look it proves quite large and intimate, thanks to its multi-functional furniture and the highly modern spaces.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25980" title="Contemporary Eko Park Apartment Interior - living room" src="Contemporary-Eko-Park-Apartment-Interior-living-room.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="471"></p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of the apartment is the open space living room that houses a luxurious kitchen and a rather elegant dining room. On top of that, there are floor-to-ceiling windows that allow plenty of natural lighting on the lacquered oak, mild colored, wooden furniture that adds up to the pristine environment. Other places of the apartment can be reached via three-meter high Rimadesio doors made of glass and aluminum.</p>
<p>Speaking of other spaces, we’re totally sold on the way the bedroom has been designed — with lots of white to make it airy and peaceful, adorned with fancy accessories. Not sure if I’d be game for such a bathroom entrance though, as I like a bit more privacy when it comes to going to the place where even the king goes alone. Other than that, the beautiful Zeppelin lamp from Flos hanging over the bathtub from Victor and Rolf, is quite enticing.</p>

<p>Designed for two real estate professionals and their two sons, the Jarson Residence by Will Bruder + Partners rises as a quiet and imposing structure from the desert surrounding it. Overlooking the McDowell Mountains to the north east, this spectacular dream home is dressed in a skin made of weathered steel and cooper pierced by large glazed areas. The cladding fabricates a strong connection to the surroundings, while the glass walls and windows framing the views construct a lighthouse effect during the night, when the lights are turned on.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25913" title="Jarson Residence" src="Jarson-Residence.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="575"></p>
<p>Displaying a rectangular shape with deep overhangs, the Jarson Residence welcomes family with the living, dining and cooking spaces downstairs. Next to them, a media room and potter’s studio present the inhabitant’s passions and hobbies, while the upstairs area is reserved for the private quarters. You might want to take a closer look at this residence, it has so many beautiful details! (<em>Found on ArchitectsList</em>)</p>

<p>Ever wondered how children of today have gone out of touch with other family members? If you go for a survey, you could see that most of them have private bedrooms. There was a time when the whole family shared the same bedroom and the result was very evident in their social life too. Here’s an easy solution to bring back those good old days.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25867" title="functional Shared Bedroom Styles Ideas" src="functional-Shared-Bedroom-Styles-Ideas.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="499"></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25875" title="beige modern shared bedroom" src="beige-modern-shared-bedroom.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="360"></p>
<p>These furniture ideas for shared bedrooms wouldn’t seem to interfere with anyone’s privacy; rather it would strengthen the bonds between members of the family. Each bed is meant for a single person, and they are distantly separated. The arrangement seems to save a lot of space, so you could utilize them for more furniture or for some other purposes you prefer.</p>
<p>Here, we are mainly focusing on designs from an Italian firm, Tumidei; and another from designer Kristen Panitch (last picture of them all). Tumidei has got a range of designs in various patterns, from which you could select one according to your preference. Some of those patterns include movable beds and raised beds. Closets, wardrobes, study area, or an attic-like space is carved out close to the lower bed.</p>

<p>It appears that these are very smart innovations. Kristen Panitch has conceptualized a range of bunk beds. This includes a rack to keep your books in place, a study table, and a showcase, which helps you to keep your kid’s belongings in a disciplined manner.</p>

<p>The curve seems to have taken its might back again with the <strong>Mop House</strong> in<strong> Al-Nuzha, Kuwait</strong> — it appears to be marvelous in the backdrop of spectacular greenery and curved walls, painted in creamy- whitish color.  The brilliant architecture of the Mop House has be commissioned to the creative folks from AGI Architects who came out with this incredible layout, ideally suited for a house located in an arid atmosphere, existing in countries like Kuwait.</p>

<p>Mop house has two entrances: a public entrance and a private one too. Walking straight through the entrance will lead you into the guest room; behind which is a large swimming pool and surrounding the pool is vast living area. On top of that  it has relatively larger rooms, and has provisions for ample air circulation. Air circulation keeps the interiors cool, despite the harsh atmosphere prevailing in the Middle East region.</p>
<p>Further cooling is provided by wooden paneling given at intervals along the tall walls. The interior looks as wonderful as exterior. Very beautiful and expensive furniture are just another brilliant treat to your eyes. The house gets its design after taking positional, environmental, and climatic factors into consideration. The designers seem to have taken extra care to provide a good amount of privacy.</p>
<p>The exteriors appear to have well separated from interior, compared to contemporary western houses. The Mop house has got enough space to contain a family of four or five. <em>(found on Contemporist)</em></p>

<p>The Celato storage unit was created for those looking for a modern piece of furniture that does not display its function at first glance, but rather hides it away from indiscreet eyes.
